              Below you'll find resources on how to get your summer garden going with the seeds we've sent you.
              We recommend that you start as soon as possible, before it gets
              too hot for the seeds to germinate properly. Plus, the sooner you plant, the sooner you'll receive a tree!

              P.S. There's already a vibrant network of hundreds of urban growers in the West Adams area who regularly meet up to swap crops and exchange info.
              During lockdown, they've still been hosting virtual events. Find out more about LA Crop Swap <a href="https://www.meetup.com/cropswapla/">here</a>!

                  Tomatoes like half-day sun. Thus, if possible, choose a planting site that is either on the east or west side of your lot.
                  In fact, tomatoes are vulnerable to getting scorched by the heat. This means that the eastern side is preferable,
                  since mornings are cooler than afternoons.

                  Dig a shallow 1/4 inch trench that is several feet long. Every 36 inches, place a coconut coir disc (small round brown discs in package).
                  We gave only three discs per packet of eggplant/tomato seeds, so place what you can until you run out. The discs help the soil
                  to better drain, especially given that LA soil tends to be hard clay. Thus, this will be a good opportunity to see if your tomatoes with the discs
                  do better than those without.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Water thoroughly. Once the water has expanded the discs and seeped into the soil, sprinkle a few seeds where you placed the discs. Cover the trenches.
                  Lightly pack the soil. Water regularly.

                <p>
                  Congratulations! You've received the crops that require a little more thought to set up, but I am confident you'll be successful.
                  Corn and beans are stronger together, as a <b>polyculture</b>. You will plant the beans with the provided "incoulant": beneficial symbiotic bacteria that "fix"
                  nitrogen, one of the three vital plant macronutrients. Once fixed, the nitrogen can then be used by the beans as well as the corn.
                  The corn stalks in turn provide structure for the beans to grow on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both the corn and the beans prefer half-day sun. Thus, if possible, choose a planting site on either the eastern or western
                  side of your lot. You need to give the corn a three week headstart before the beans. Corn needs to be planted in close side-by-side rows to allow for wind
                  pollination. Dig four trenches that are 1 inch deep, each a couple feet long,
                  and 2-3 feet apart. (If you're limited by the number of corn kernels, three trenches are okay too.) Water thoroughly. Once the water has seeped into the soil, drop one kernel every 9 inches. Cover the trenches
                  and lightly pack the soil. Water regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After three weeks, make a couple 1 inch deep holes around each successfully germinated corn plant. Pour the contents of the "inoculant"
                  packet into a bowl for ease of application. In each hole, place a bean and sprinkle a small amount of inoculant. The idea is to give
                  each of your ~16 beans an equal amount of inoculant. If the timing is right,
                  the beans should germinate and naturally train themselves up the stalks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corn should be ready to harvest after ~11 total weeks and the beans will be ready soon thereafter. Here's a
                  <a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/corn/tips-for-harvesting-corn.htm">quick guide</a>
                  for knowing when your corn is ready to harvest. As for the beans, they should be picked when plump.

              they all received seeds too; thus, feel free to coordinate with them about planting your respective seeds!
              <b>Important:</b> Soak your chosen area BEFORE planting to ensure there's plenty of water.

            <p>
              After the water has soaked into your planting site (but before it has dried up), plant your seeds by using a shovel, trowel, stick, finger, etc. to dig a trench or hole.
              Again, refer to the buttons above for specific instructions on how deep and spread apart to plant the seeds. You may find a grayish powder on the seeds or
              at the bottom of the packet. This is "mycorrhizal" fungi; they have a symbiotic relationship with the vast majority of crops we've
              domesticated. Essentially, they extend the plant's reach for nutrients and water. Thus, as best as you can,
              ensure that some of the powder gets planted with the seeds; a very small amount goes a LONG way, especially when applied to seeds. Wash your hands afterwards!
            </p>
            <p>
              Once planted, they'll need regular watering, everyday when they're first beginning to germinate and 2-3 days thereafter.

              for a dirt-simple auto watering system if you don't think you'll be able to water by hand reliably. You may also have to remove weeds
              that will compete for nutrients and possibly shade out your crops, especially in the early stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              If hand-watering,
              <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-best-time-to-water-your-plants-during-a-heatwave-99244">this article</a> provides tips on
              best times to water, especially during hotter weather, and how to avoid overwatering. In a nutshell, late afternoon/early evening is best so that water
              seeps into the soil before being evaporated and there's still time for leaves to dry off.

              After several weeks, if everything goes right you should have a bounty to harvest. Congrats!
              At this point, we'll ask you to take a photo of what you've grown and we'll coordinate the delivery of your tree in the fall.
              Don't worry if something goes wrong with your crops!
              As long as we see that you've at least tried, then we'll send you a tree. Gardening can be unpredictable!

                Congratulations! You've received the crops that require a little more thought to set up, but I am confident you'll be successful.
                Corn and beans are stronger together, as a <b>polyculture</b>. The beans have been mixed with beneficial symbiotic bacteria that "fix"
                nitrogen, one of the three vital macronutrients. Once fixed, the nitrogen can then be used by the beans as well as the corn.
                The corn stalks in turn provide structure for the beans to grow on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both the corn and the beans prefer half-day sun. Thus, if possible, choose a planting site on either the eastern or western
                side of your lot. You need to give the corn a three week headstart before the beans. Corn needs to be planted in close side-by-side rows to allow for wind
                pollination. Dig four trenches that are 1 inch deep, several feet long,
                and 2-3 feet apart. Water thoroughly. Once the water has seeped into the soil, drop a kernel every 9 inches. Cover the trenches
                and lightly pack the soil. Water regularly.
              </p>
              <p>
                After three weeks, plant a few beans 1 inch deep around each successfully germinated corn plant. If the timing is right,
                the beans should naturally train themselves up the stalks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The corn should be ready to harvest after ~11 total weeks and the beans will be ready soon thereafter. TODO: add info about when to harvest corn.

                Water thoroughly. Once the water has seeped into the soil, drop 1-2 seeds into holes, and cover them up.
                Lightly pack the soil. Water regularly.

                Tomatoes like half-day sun. Thus, if possible, choose a planting site that is either on the east or west side of your lot.
                In fact, tomatoes are vulnerable to getting scorched by the heat. This means that the eastern side is preferable,
                since mornings are cooler than afternoons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dig a shallow 1/4 inch trench that is several feet long. Every 36 inches, place a coconut coir disc (small round brown discs in package).
                Water thoroughly. Once the water has expanded the discs and seeped into the soil, drop a few seeds where you placed the discs. Cover the trenches.
                Lightly pack the soil. Water regularly.
              </p>
              <p>
                After 2 weeks, seedlings should start to emerge. After 10 weeks or so, you should start to see red ripe fruits. Check every few days. Enjoy!
